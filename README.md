> **Note**: This is a community-maintained fork of [schaka/janitorr](https://github.com/schaka/janitorr) with additional features including a Management Web UI and comprehensive multi-language documentation. See [FORK_CHANGES.md](FORK_CHANGES.md) for details.

### Inspiration

This application is heavily inspired by (but not a fork of) [Maintainerr](https://github.com/jorenn92/Maintainerr).
If you're within the Plex ecosystem, want an easy to use GUI and more sophisticated functionality, you're better off using it instead.

### Warning

Please use at your own risk.
You may enable dry-run mode. This is enabled in the config template by default.
Unless you disable dry-run mode, nothing will be deleted.
Refer to the logging section to see what actions Janitorr will take.

If you still don't trust Janitorr, you may enable Recycle Bin in the *arrs and disable Jellyfin/Emby.
This way, no deletes will be triggered on Jellyfin and everthing triggered in the *arrs will only go to the Recycle Bin.

### Introduction

**Janitorr** manages your media and cleans up after you.

- Do you hate being the janitor of your server?
- Do you have a lot of media that never gets watched?
- Do your users constantly request media, and let it sit there afterward never to be touched again?

Then you need Janitorr for Jellyfin and Emby.
It's THE solution for cleaning up your server and freeing up space before you run into issues.

### Important notes

- Janitorr does **not** delete items after they were watched. Look into [Jellyfin Media Cleaner](https://github.com/shemanaev/jellyfin-plugin-media-cleaner) for that.
- **I don't use Emby. I implemented and tested it, but for maintenance I rely on bug reports**
- Only one of Jellyfin or Emby can be enabled at a time
- Only one of Jellystat or Streamystats can be enabled at a time
- "Leaving Soon" Collections are *always* created and do not care for dry-run settings
- Jellyfin and Emby require user access to delete files, an API key is not enough - I recommend creating a user specifically for this task
- **For media to be picked up, it needs to have been downloaded by the Radarr/Sonarr**
- Jellyfin/Emby and Jellyseerr are not required, but if you don't supply them, you may end up with orphaned folders,  metadata, etc

### Management UI ‚úÖ

Janitorr includes a comprehensive web-based management interface accessible at `http://<host>:<port>/` when the application is running.

The management UI allows you to:
- **View system status** - Monitor current configuration and cleanup state
- **Manually trigger cleanups** - Run any cleanup function on-demand
- **Configure via Web UI** - Complete configuration management without editing YAML files
- **Test connections** - Verify connectivity to all external services (Sonarr, Radarr, Jellyfin, etc.)
- **Manage backups** - Create, restore, import, and export configurations
- **Real-time validation** - Test and validate settings before saving
- See real-time feedback on cleanup operations

![Management UI Working](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-‚úÖ%20Fully%20Functional-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI accessible from any browser
- ‚úÖ **System Status**: View current configuration and cleanup status in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Manual Triggers**: Execute any cleanup function on-demand with one click
- ‚úÖ **Live Monitoring**: Track which cleanups have been executed and when
- ‚úÖ **Instant Feedback**: See real-time feedback on cleanup operations

**Quick Start:**
1. Start Janitorr with Docker Compose (see [setup guide](#setting-up-docker))
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8978/` (or your configured port)
3. View status and trigger manual cleanups instantly!

**Available at:** `http://<your-server-ip>:8978/`

For detailed documentation, see [MANAGEMENT_UI.md](MANAGEMENT_UI.md).

### Logging
You may check the container logs for Janitorr to observe what the application wants to do.
Janitorr logs to stdout, so you can view your logs in Docker. However, it is recommended to enable file logging in your config instead.
If file logging is enabled, please make sure the location you've chosen for the log file is mapped into the container, so that Janitorr can write log files to the host and not inside the container.

To enable debug logging, change `INFO` in the following line in `application.yml` to either `DEBUG` or `TRACE`:

```yml
    com.github.schaka: INFO
```

### Troubleshooting
Before you create a new issue, please check previous issues to make sure nobody has faced the same problem before.

**üìñ Check the documentation:**

## Setup

Currently, the code is only published as a docker image to [GitHub](https://github.com/Schaka/janitorr/pkgs/container/janitorr).
If you cannot use Docker, you'll have to compile it yourself from source.

Depending on the configuration, files will be deleted if they are older than x days. Age is determined by your grab
history in the *arr apps. By default, it will choose the oldest file in the history.
If Jellystat or Streamystats is set up, the most recent watch date overwrites the grab history, if it exists.

To exclude media from being considered from deletion, set the `janitorr_keep` tag in Sonarr/Radarr. The actual tag
Janitorr looks for can be adjusted in your config file.

### Setting up Docker

> **üìñ For a comprehensive step-by-step guide, see the [Docker Compose Setup Guide](docs/wiki/en/Docker-Compose-Setup.md)** (also available in [Spanish](docs/wiki/es/Configuracion-Docker-Compose.md))

- follow the mapping for `application.yml` examples below
- within that host folder, put a copy of [application.yml](https://github.com/Schaka/janitorr/blob/develop/src/main/resources/application-template.yml) from this repository
- adjust said copy with your own info like *arr, Jellyfin and Jellyseerr API keys and your preferred port

If using Jellyfin with **filesystem access**, ensure that Janitorr has access to the exact directory structure for the leaving-soon-dir as Jellyfin.
Additionally, make sure the *arrs directories are mapped into your container the same way for Janitorr as well.
Janitorr receives info about where files are located by the *arrs - so the path needs to be available to both.

Janitorr creates symlinks from whatever directory it receives from the arrs' API into the `leaving-soon-dir`.
If Radarr finds movies at `/data/media/movies` Janitorr needs to find them at `/data/media/movies` too.
You need to ensure links can be created from the source (in the *arrs' library) to the destination (leaving-soon).

The only exception is your `leaving-soon-dir`. If Jellyfin and Janitorr know this directory under different paths, you can just this.
By default, both `media-server-leaving-soon-dir` and `leaving-soon-dir` should be identical if your volume mappings are identical.


If Janitorr's mapping looks like this:
`/share_media/media/leaving-soon:/data/media/leaving-soon`

And Jellyfin's like this:
`/share_media/media/leaving-soon:/library/leaving-soon`

Then your `application.yml` should look like:
```
leaving-soon-dir: "/data/media/leaving-soon"
media-server-leaving-soon-dir: "/library/leaving-soon"
```

**You may also check out [this example](examples/example-compose.yml) of a full stack setup.**

**After starting Janitorr:**
- ‚úÖ Access the Management UI at `http://localhost:8978/` (or your configured port)
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints available at `http://localhost:8978/api/management/`
- ‚úÖ Trigger manual cleanups instantly from the web interface

### Docker config

Before using this, please make sure you've created the `application.yml` file and put it in the correct config directory you intend to map.
The application requires it. You need to supply it, or Janitorr will not start correctly.
You don't have to publish ANY ports on the host machine.
If you're seeing any problems, consult [the Wiki](https://github.com/Schaka/janitorr/wiki/Troubleshooting).

An example of a `docker-compose.yml` may look like this:

```yml
services:
  janitorr:
    container_name: janitorr
    image: ghcr.io/carcheky/janitorr:latest
    user: 1000:1000 # Replace with your user who should own your application.yml file
    mem_limit: 256M # is used to dynamically calculate heap size, can go as low as 200MB, but 256 is recommended - higher for very large libraries
    mem_swappiness: 0
    volumes:
      - /appdata/janitorr/config/application.yml:/config/application.yml
      - /appdata/janitorr/logs:/logs
      - /share_media:/data
    environment:
      # Uses https://github.com/dmikusa/tiny-health-checker supplied by paketo buildpacks
      - THC_PATH=/health
      - THC_PORT=8081
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "/workspace/health-check" ]
      start_period: 30s
      interval: 5s
      retries: 3
```
